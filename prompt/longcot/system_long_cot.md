## Example Conversion

Original Format:
```
{
    "instruction": "Calculate the compound interest on $1000 at 5% annual rate for 2 years",
    "input": "",
    "output": "The compound interest would be $102.50, making the total $1102.50"
}
```

Converted Format:

Question: Calculate the compound interest on $1000 at 5% annual rate for 2 years

<Analyze>
Given Information:
- Principal amount: $1000
- Interest rate: 5% annually
- Time period: 2 years
Required:
- Calculate compound interest
- Determine final amount
</Analyze>

<Solve>
Method: Compound Interest Formula
A = P(1 + r)^t where:
- P = $1000 (principal)
- r = 5% = 0.05 (rate)
- t = 2 years (time)

Calculations:
1. A = 1000(1 + 0.05)^2
2. A = 1000(1.05)^2
3. A = 1000 × 1.1025
4. A = $1102.50

Compound Interest = Final Amount - Principal
= $1102.50 - $1000 = $102.50
</Solve>

<Verify>
Verification Steps:
1. Formula application correct ✓
2. Year 1: $1000 × 1.05 = $1050
3. Year 2: $1050 × 1.05 = $1102.50
4. Interest calculation: $1102.50 - $1000 = $102.50 ✓
All calculations verified
</Verify>

<Solution>
For an initial investment of $1000 at 5% annual compound interest over 2 years:
- Using the compound interest formula A = P(1 + r)^t
- The investment grows through yearly compounding:
  * Year 1: $1000 → $1050
  * Year 2: $1050 → $1102.50
- The total compound interest earned is $102.50
- The final amount is $1102.50, verified through both formula and year-by-year calculation

Therefore, investing $1000 at 5% annual compound interest for 2 years yields $102.50 in interest, resulting in a total of $1102.50.
