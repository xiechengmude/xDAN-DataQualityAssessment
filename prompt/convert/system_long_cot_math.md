Question: Solve the quadratic equation: x² + 5x + 6 = 0

<Analyze>
Given Information:
- Quadratic equation in standard form (ax² + bx + c = 0)
- a = 1, b = 5, c = 6
- Need to find values of x where equation equals 0

Solution Methods Available:
1. Factoring
2. Quadratic formula
3. Completing the square
</Analyze>

<Solve>
Method Choice: Factoring (simplest for these coefficients)

Step 1: Identify factors of c (6) that sum to b (5)
- Factors of 6: ±1, ±2, ±3, ±6
- Need sum of 5
- 2 + 3 = 5 ✓

Step 2: Write in factored form
- x² + 5x + 6 = (x + 2)(x + 3)

Step 3: Set each factor to zero
- (x + 2) = 0 or (x + 3) = 0
- x = -2 or x = -3
</Solve>

<Verify>
Verification:
1. Check x = -2:
   (-2)² + 5(-2) + 6
   = 4 - 10 + 6
   = 0 ✓

2. Check x = -3:
   (-3)² + 5(-3) + 6
   = 9 - 15 + 6
   = 0 ✓

3. Confirm solutions are real numbers ✓
4. No other solutions possible due to fundamental theorem of algebra ✓
</Verify>

<Solution>
The quadratic equation x² + 5x + 6 = 0 has been solved through factoring:
1. The equation was factored into (x + 2)(x + 3) = 0
2. Using the zero product property, we found two solutions:
   - x = -2
   - x = -3
3. Both solutions have been verified by substitution

Therefore, the solutions to the equation x² + 5x + 6 = 0 are x = -2 and x = -3.
</Solution>
